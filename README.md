# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying news as **real or fake** using various machine learning algorithms.

## 🔍 Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Linear Regression (for demonstration only)

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes two files:
- `True.csv` — Contains real news articles  
- `Fake.csv` — Contains fake news articles

Source: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

## 🛠️ Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Text Vectorization using TF-IDF  
3. Model Training and Evaluation  
4. Accuracy Comparison of Models
